I'm a fourth year undergraduate studying mathematics at the University of Washington. I particularly like algebraic and geometric topology, although many kinds of math interest me. I'm also a TA for Math 224 at UW right now.

Outside of math, I like reading, writing, swimming, and running. If you're looking for me, check the nearest park bench for someone staring at nothing while drinking coffee and listening to an audiobook.
